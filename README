This project is an example of a frontend application written in
React.js, using Axios to make http requests to connect to the Edamam
food database API. Upon searching for a recipe or ingredient, the
API returns the top ten results. Using Materialize CSS, the
information is then neatly displayed inside of the UI for the user
to interact with. State is also managed with the Context API and
this app utilizes react hooks throughout.




Some of the dependencies: 

-Materialize CSS
-uuid for generating unique id's
-axios
